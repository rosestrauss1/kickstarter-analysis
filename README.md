# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to compare different fundraising projects based on their launch dates and fundraising goals. Two data visualizations we can create to better understand this relationship is by creating a chart showing fundraising outcomes, whether the fundraiser was a success or failure, based on launch date, and another chart that compares outcomes based on the fundraising goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The only challenge I faced during this process was I was trying to apply a calculation to a page that I filtered before without filtering it on an equation. My calculations did not work because of this. I inspected every element to see why my graph was not picking up on certain values and realized that the filtering needed to be done on a separate page.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first conclusion I can draw from the Theater Outcome by Launch Date chart is that most successful campaigns started out around May. Fewer successful campaigns launched every month later than May, and the number only picked up slightly around October then further decreased in September. From this, I can conclude that launching a fundraiser in May is ideal. A second conclusion I can make from this graph is that the number of campaigns that failed to meet their fundraising goals remained much more constant throughout the year than the number that succeeded. This could mean that the chances of not meeting your fundraising goal??

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

From the outcomes based on goals chart, I can conclude that very small fundraising goals have a relatively high chance of meeting their goals, from less than $1000 to $1000- $4999. Beyond that, the chances of meeting fundraising goals decreased until it hits around $35,000. When the goal is over $44,999, the chance of meeting that goal decreases rapidly. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One limitation of this data set is that it does not include a mean donation, just an average. This could impact the data available because fundraising techniques that are most effective might not be able to be properly inferred. There could be many situations where someone could be hosting a fundraiser and most people donate a relatively small amount, but one person donates most of the money. This might not be as useful as having information on a large number of smaller contributions, which could not be understood through an average of the donation amount. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another graph you could create with this data set is a graph showing the number of backers over the duration of a fundraiser to see if there is any crucial time period that the fundraiser is gaining more momentum with a larger amount of donors.
